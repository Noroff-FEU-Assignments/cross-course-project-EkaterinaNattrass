    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">First of all you need to choose the host server smartly. You shouldn't go for the cheapest one or the one with the best ad. You should prioritise a good security level, so choose the host that has WAF and is able to save your website from, for example, DDoS attacks. 
        It's important to have a two-factor authentication or 2FA for the login to the website, which means having both user´s login and password and a numerical code or a different password sent to user´s phone or email every time the user logs in) It stands true not only for your clients, but also for your employees, who must have a two-step authentication and strong and reliable passwords containing letters, numbers and symbols. It might be a good idea to limit their access to the whole website, keeping  just to the part their work is connected to. It's also a good idea to limit the number of login attempts to prevent unauthorised login attempts from malicious users.
        Another essential thing is to always have a backup in case of an emergency. Automatic backups, for example, once a week can be a lifesaver after an attack on the website, because it's always easier to recreate than to build from scratch.
